## What is ShowNet?

**ShowNet** is a large demonstration network built at [Interop
Tokyo](https://interop.jp), the largest annual exhibition of Internet
technologies in Japan. ShowNet provides internet connectivity for
interop exhibitors and visitors while conducting interoperability
tests and various demonstrations of the latest networking technologies
every year. [This article in the Internet Protocol Journal](https://ipj.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/281-ipj.pdf) explains what Interop Tokyo ShowNet is.

ShowNet is designed for 6 months, built for 12 days, and operated for
3 days during the exhibition by over 300 engineers with various
backgrounds.
